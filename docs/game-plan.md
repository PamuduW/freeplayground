# FreePlayground Game Plan (12 months)

This repo is my public engineering lab notebook and proof-of-work log.

The goal is consistent growth across DevOps fundamentals, cloud, automation, and security, resulting in a portfolio I can show confidently in interviews.

## Principles
- WSL-first workflow: projects live in the Linux filesystem and tooling runs inside WSL.
- Quota-based progress: finish the weekly deliverable, not “work every day”.
- Dynamic plan, fixed outcomes: scope can change, outcomes stay the same.
- Slip rule: if work slips, it can roll forward, but not by more than 2 weeks without rebalancing scope.

## Success outcomes (end of 12 months)
By the end of this plan, this repo should demonstrate:
- Strong DevOps fundamentals (Linux, Git, CI/CD, containers, Kubernetes, IaC).
- Solid cloud foundations (AWS + Azure) with cost discipline and teardown habits.
- Real DevSecOps practices (CI security checks, basic threat modeling, IAM hygiene, supply chain awareness).
- Automation mindset (small tools/scripts that remove repetitive work).
- A consistent weekly proof-of-work trail with evidence.

## Weekly cadence
Every week ships:
1) A deliverable (doc, lab, script, pipeline, diagram, or mini-project)
2) Evidence (screenshots, links, outputs)
3) A short retro (what worked, what to improve)

Weekly notes live in:
- `docs/weekly/week-XX.md`

Template:
- `docs/weekly/_template.md`

## Plan document (source of truth)
The detailed 12-month weekly plan lives in the project files for this ChatGPT workspace:
- "Pamudu Dev Sec Ops Game Plan (weekly, 12 Months).docx"
- "Pamudu Dev Sec Ops Game Plan (weekly, 12 Months).pdf"

This `docs/game-plan.md` file is the living index and will be updated if the plan is adjusted.

## Current status
- Week 01: repo initialized, CI scaffold created, mirroring enabled, weekly notes started
- Next: complete cloud cost guardrails (AWS + Azure), then begin Week 02
