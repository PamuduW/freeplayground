# Week 01 - Kickoff and setup

## This week’s outcome
Set up FreePlayground as a long-term engineering growth repo with a working CI pipeline and a clean structure for weekly shipping.

## Must ship (minimum)
- [x] Repo structure created (folders + docs)
- [x] GitLab CI pipeline runs on every push
- [x] Pipeline badge added to README
- [x] Cost guardrails checked (AWS + Azure)

## What I built
- A baseline repo structure for labs, notes, and weekly deliverables
- A minimal GitLab pipeline that confirms CI is alive

## What I learned
- How to set up a mirrored repo from GitLab to GitHub
- How the GitLab badges work
- How the GitLab CI works
