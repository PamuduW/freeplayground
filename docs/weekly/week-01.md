# Week 01 - Kickoff and setup

Set up FreePlayground as a long-term engineering growth repo with a working CI pipeline and a clean structure for weekly shipping.

## Must ship (minimum)
- [ ] Repo structure created (folders + docs)
- [ ] GitLab CI pipeline runs on every push
- [ ] Pipeline badge added to README
- [ ] Cost guardrails checked (AWS + Azure)

## What I built
- A baseline repo structure for labs, notes, and weekly deliverables
- A minimal GitLab pipeline that confirms CI is alive

## What I learned (write 3 to 6 bullets)
-

## Evidence
- GitHub repo link:
- GitLab pipeline link:
- Screenshot or log snippet (optional):

## Next week (preview)
- Start Docker foundations: build, run, debug, Compose basics
